            <h2>Become a web Developer</h2>
            <p>Dreaming big means having the mental freedom to think about what you really want out of life and forget
                about
                all the reasons why you can't make it a reality. ... Someone could use dreaming big to motivate
                themselves
                to see the bigger picture of what they really want in life.</p>
